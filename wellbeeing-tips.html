                <p class="text-content">
                   Nature have a really calming effect on us. We have been living around other animals and plants for thousands of years. Being in nature reduces fear and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.

                <p class="text-content">
                   Our bodies and minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health.
Exercise causes your body to release endorphins, the chemicals in your brain relieve pain and stress, reduces the levels of stress hormones and adrenaline. Studies have shown that 30 minutes of exercise each day can make people feel calmer.

                <p class="text-content">
                    Eating a balanced and healthy diet is key to helping our bodies to manage the physiological changes caused by stress. Choose whole, natural foods and ensure a minimum of five portions of non-starchy vegetables per day. Having meals with other people can help to grow relationships – with family, friends, partners, and colleagues. This is really important in protecting everyone’s mental health and preventing problems.

                <p class="text-content">
                    Talking may also change how you see and feel about the situation in ways you find helpful. Use your own words. If you have concerns, stresses or worries, sharing these with someone who cares is one of the most effective ways to calm your nervous system and relieve stress. It’ll make you feel safer and less alone, and that will help protect your mental health and prevent problems.

                <p class="text-content">
              Sleep is a powerful stress reducer. Following a regular sleep routine calms and restores the body, improves concentration, regulates mood, and sharpens judgment and decision-making. You are a better problem solver and are better able to cope with stress when you're well-rested. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, reduces your energy and diminishes mental clarity.
